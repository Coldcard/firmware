## Check-out and Setup

Do a checkout, recursively to get all the submodules:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Coldcard/firmware.git

Then:

- `cd firmware`
- `git submodule update --init` _(if needed?)_
- `brew install autogen`
- `virtualenv -p python3 ENV` (Python > 3.5 is required)
- `source ENV/bin/activate` (or `source ENV/bin/activate.csh` based on shell preference)
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Setup and Run the Desktop-based Coldcard simulator:

- `cd unix; make setup && make; ./simulator.py`

Building the firmware:

- `cd ../cli; pip install --editable .`
- `cd ../stm32; make setup && make; make firmware-signed.dfu`
- The resulting file, `firmware-signed.dfu` can be loaded directly onto a Coldcard, using this
  command (already installed based on above)
- `ckcc upgrade firmware-signed.dfu`

Which looks like this:

    [ENV] [firmware/stm32 42] ckcc upgrade firmware-signed.dfu
    675328 bytes (start @ 293) to send from 'firmware-signed.dfu'

### MacOS

You'll probably need to install at least these packages:

    brew cask install xquartz
    brew install sdl2 xterm
    brew cask install gcc-arm-none-eabi

Used to be these were needed as well:

    brew tap PX4/px4
    brew search px4
    brew install px4/px4/gcc-arm-none-eabi-80 (latest gcc-arm-none-eabi-XX, currently 80)

You may need to reboot to avoid a `DISPLAY is not set` error.

### Linux

You'll probably need to install these (Ubuntu 16):

    apt install libudev-dev python-sdl2 gcc-arm-none-eabi

If you get stuck on the "Skip PIN" screen after the startup, edit the `pyb.py` file located under `/unix/frozen-modules/` and follow the instructions from line 27 to line 31:
```
# If on linux, try commenting the following line
addr = bytes([len(fn)+2, socket.AF_UNIX] + list(fn))
# If on linux, try uncommenting the following two lines
#import struct
#addr = struct.pack('H108s', socket.AF_UNIX, fn)
```

## Code Organization

Top-level dirs:

`shared`

- shared code between desktop test version and real-deal
- expected to be largely in python, and higher-level

`unix`

- unix (MacOS) version for testing/rapid dev
- this is a simulator for the product

`testing`

- test cases and associated data


`stm32`

- embedded micro version, for actual product
- final target is a binary file for loading onto hardware

`external`

- code from other projects, ie. the dreaded submodules

`stm32/bootloader`

- 32k of factory-set code that you cannot change
- however, you can inspect what code is on your coldcard and compare to this.

`hardware`

- schematic and bill of materials for the Coldcard
