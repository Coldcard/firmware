## 5.1.4 - 2023-09-08

- Bugfix: Most users would see a red light after upgrade to 5.1.3 from 5.1.2. Fixed.

## 5.1.3 - 2023-09-07

- New Feature: Batch sign multiple PSBT files. `Advanced/Tools -> File Management -> Batch Sign PSBT`
- Enhancement: `Sparrow Wallet` added as an individual export option (same file contents)
- Enhancement: change key origin information export format in multisig `addresses.csv` to match
  [BIP-0380](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0380.mediawiki#key-expressions)
  was `(m=0F056943)/m/48'/1'/0'/2'/0/0` now `[0F056943/48'/1'/0'/2'/0/0]`
- Enhancement: Address explorer UX cosmetics, now with arrows and dots.
- Enhancement: Linked settings (multisig, trick pins, backup password, hsm users and utxo cache)
  separation for new main secret.
- Rename `Unchained Capital` to `Unchained`
- Bugfix: Correct `scriptPubkey` parsing for segwit v1-v16
- Bugfix: Do not infer segwit just by availability of `PSBT_IN_WITNESS_UTXO` in PSBT.
- Bugfix: Remove label from Bitcoin Core `importdescriptors` export as it is no longer supported
  with ranged descriptors in version `24.1` of Core.
- Bugfix: Empty number during BIP-39 passphrase entry could cause crash.
- Bugfix: Signing with BIP39 Passphrase showed master fingerprint as integer. Fixed to show hex.
- Bugfix: Fixed inability to generate paper wallet without secrets
- Bugfix: Activating trick pin duress wallet copied multisig settings from main wallet
- Bugfix: SD2FA setting is cleared when seed is wiped after failed login due to policy SD2FA enforce.
  Prevents infinite seed wipe loop when restoring backup after 2FA MicroSD lost or damaged.
  SD2FA is not backed up and also not restored from older backups. If SD2FA is set up,
  it will not survive restore of backup.
- Bugfix: Terms only presented if main PIN was not chosen already.
- Bugfix: Preserve defined order of Login Countdown settings list.
- Bugfix: Remove unsupported trick pin option `Look Blank` from `if wrong` (not supported by bootrom).


## 5.1.2 - 2023-04-07

- Enhancement: Support all `SIGHASH` types (previously only `SIGHASH_ALL` was supported).
  This can enable specialized Bitcoin transactions involving multiple signers and even
  limited changes to the transaction after signing. To enable the most dangerous SIGHASH
  modes, you must change `Advanced -> Danger Zone -> Sighash Checks`. Warnings are shown
  for all of the new SIGHASH modes regardless of this setting.
- Enhancement: SeedXOR now supports 12 and 18 words mnemonics.
- Enhancement: Signing memory, speed optimizations.
- Enhancement: Docker repro build container improvements (non-privileged container)
- Bugfix: After extended private key and TAPSIGNER backup import into blank wallet,
  users needed to manually reboot Coldcard.
- Bugfix: Do not set SIGHASH type on foreign PSBT inputs
- Bugfix: "Validating..." screen would be shown twice in some cases. Improves signing performance.


## 5.1.1 - 2023-02-27

- Bugfix: Same as 5.1.0 but corrects issue which prevented 5.1.0 from being upgraded
  over SD card. No functional changes.


## 5.1.0 - 2023-02-27

- New Feature: "MicroSD card as Second Factor". Specially marked MicroSD card must be
  already inserted when (true) PIN is entered, or else seed is wiped. Add, remove and check
  cards in menu: `Settings -> Login Settings -> MicroSD 2FA`
- New Feature: Import TAPSIGNER encrypted backup as main or ephemeral seed, for PSBT signing.
- New Feature: Detached Bitcoin signature files (most exports)
    - Files exported are now signed with a detached signature. Look for a `.sig` file
      with the same name, and verify signature with your favourite Bitcoin tools.
      See "Signed Exports" in `docs/msg-signing.md` fo more information.
    - Coldcard can now verify signed files: 
        - SD card and Virtual disk `Advanced/Tools -> File Management -> Verify Sig File`
        - NFC `Advanced/Tools -> NFC Tools -> Verify Sig File`
- Address Explorer:
    - Enhancement: Application-specific derivation paths in `Address Explorer -> Applications`
    - Bugfix: Change value was ignored when generating addresses file
- Import Enhancements:
    - Add import multisig wallet via Virtual Disk
    - Add import extended private key via Virtual Disk and via NFC
    - Import seed in compact/truncated form (just 3-4 letters of each seed word)
    - Import extended private key as ephemeral seed
- Export Enhancements: 
    - Samourai POST-MIX and PRE-MIX descriptor export options added
    - Lily Wallet added
    - Ability to export all supported wallets via NFC (instead of SD card only)
    - Change electrum export file name from 'new-wallet.json' to 'new-electrum.json'
    - Allow export of Wasabi skeleton for Bitcoin Regtest.
- Backup Enhancement:
    - Option to save the backup file's encryption password for next backup. Then next
      backup is quick and simple: no need to record yet another 12 words.
- Enhancement: During seed generation from dice rolls, enforce at least 50 rolls
  for 12 word seeds, and 99 rolls for 24 word seeds. Statistical distribution check
- Enhancement: Single signature wallet generic descriptor export
  `Advanced -> Export Wallet -> Descriptor`. Both new format with internal/external
  in one descriptor `<0;1>` and standard with two descriptors are supported.
  added to prevent users from generating low-entropy seeds by rolling same value repeatedly.
- Bugfix: Offer import/export from/to Virtual Disk in UI even if SD Card is inserted.
- Bugfix: Recalculate extended key saved in settings upon chain change (BTC, XTN, XRT).
- Bugfix: Provide correct derivation path (m/84'/1'/0') for testnet Wasabi export.
- Bugfix: Properly display UX checkmark only if testnet (XTN, XRT) is enabled 
  in `Settings- > Danger Zone -> Testnet Mode`.
- Docs: Add `docs/rolls12.py` script for verifying dice rolls math for 12 word seeds.

## 5.0.7 - 2022-10-05

- NFC Enhancements: 
    - In older versions, multisig NFC import not offered if a MicroSD card was
      inserted, now this option provided Settings > Multisig Wallets > Import via NFC. NFC has
      to be enabled for this option to be visible in the menu.
    - NFC message signing (Advanced/Tools > NFC Tools > Sign Message). Send message
      in same format as Sign Text File over NFC, approve signing on Coldcard and send signed
      ASCII-armored message back over NFC.
    - Show address over NFC (Advanced/Tools > NFC Tools > Show Address).
    - Bugfix: Improved NFC commands exception handling 
    - Bugfix: Share single address over NFC from address explorer menu.
- HSM Enhancements: 
    - Dynamic HSM Whitelisting. Foreign outputs can be attested-to by signing them with
      private key corresponding to the address specified in HSM policy. Attestation
      signature MUST be provided in PSBT in a new proprietary field.
    - HSM policy hash is now displayed during first activation and in the HSM status
      response. This enables fast comparison against known policy hashes.
    - Thanks to [@straylight-orbit](https://github.com/straylight-orbit) for above items!
    - Now ignores HSM commands over USB, by default. To enable and use HSM features,
      go to Advanced/Tools > Enable HSM > Enable
- New Feature: Ephemeral Seeds: Advanced/Tools > Ephemeral Seed (more info in `docs/ephemeral.md`)
- Enhancement: New menu wraparound settings which allow you to scroll past top and bottom of 
  any menu (Settings > Menu Wrapping).
- Enhancement: Allow import of new descriptor type which specify both internal/external
  in single string (ie. `../<0;1>/..`). We still export in older format.
- Enhancement: add ability to specify address format in text file to be signed (3rd line of file)
- Bugfix: Correct parsing of unknown fields in PSBT: they are now passed through.
- Bugfix: Using lots of trick pins (7+), could lead to a case where the Coldcard would
  not accept the main pin, but trick pins continued to work. This release adds a
  workaround to avoid getting into that situation, and new units from the factory will
  ship with an updated bootrom (version 3.1.5).

## 5.0.6 - 2022-07-29

- Security release: Virtual Disk feature updated with bugfix to address potential security
  concerns and new security hardening changes. Upgrade strongly recommended.

## 5.0.5 - 2022-07-20

- Enhancement: BIP-85 derived passwords. Pick an index number, and COLDCARD will derive
  a deterministic, strong (136 bit) password for you. It will even type the password by
  emulating a USB keyboard. See new areas: Settings > Keyboard EMU and
  Settings > Derive Seed B85 > Passwords.
- Documentation: added `docs/bip85-passwords.md` documenting new BIP-85 passwords and
  keyboard emulation.
- Enhancement: BIP-85 derived values can now be exported via NFC, in addition to QR code.
- Enhancement: Allow signing transaction where foreign UTXO(s) are missing.
  Only applies to cases where partial signatures are being created.
  Thanks to [@straylight-orbit](https://github.com/straylight-orbit)
- Enhancement: QR Codes are now easier to scan in bright light. Thanks
  to [@russeree](https://github.com/russeree) for this useful fix!
- Bugfix: order of multisig wallet registration does NOT matter.
- Enhancement: Support import of multisig wallet from descriptor (only sortedmulti, BIP-67).
  Also support export of multsig wallet as descriptor.
- Enhancement: Address explorer can show "change" addresses for standard derivation paths
  for both single and multisig wallet.
- New tutorial: 2of2 multisig with 2x Coldcard signing device, and bitcoin-qt as
  coordinator, see `docs/bitcoin-core2of2desc.md`
- Enhancement: `OP_RETURN` is now a known script and is displayed in ascii when possible
- Bugfix: allow unknown scripts in HSM mode, with warning.

## 5.0.4 - 2022-05-27

- Enhancement: Optional USB protocol change which binds the ephemeral ECDH encryption 
  keys more tightly. Best used in HSM mode where a single long-term USB connection is
  expected. Thanks to [@DON-MAC-256](https://github.com/DON-MAC-256) for this feature.
- Enhancement: In HSM mode, when more than 1k approvals, handle overflow in display,
  thanks to [@straylight-orbit](https://github.com/straylight-orbit)
- Enhancement: Adds support for "Regtest" which are testnet coins on an isolated blockchain.
  It's only useful for developers, and should not be used otherwise.
- Enhancement: Major rework of test setup to use BitcoinCore on regtest, and support Linux devs.
- Enhancement: Pause waiting for incoming NFC data increased to 3 seconds, from one. Better 
  error reporting for debug purposes.
- Corrects obsolete domain name (`coldcardwallet.com`) in repro build script, thanks to
  [@xavierfiechter](https://github.com/xavierfiechter)
- Documentation: Secure element related fixes from [@lucasmoten](https://github.com/lucasmoten)
- Bugfix: Error if clone (receiving end) started without first inserting SD card, fixed.
- Bugfix: Reproducible build issues corrected, thanks to [@Ademan](https://github.com/Ademan)

## 5.0.3 - 2022-05-04

- Enhancement: Support P2TR outputs (pay to Taproot) in PSBT files. Allows
  on-screen verification of P2TR destination addresses (`bc1p..`) so you can send
  your BTC to them. Does **not** support signing, so you cannot operate a Taproot
  wallet with COLDCARD as the signing device... yet.

## 5.0.2 - 2022-04-19

- Adds NFC support for exporting to all the various wallet-types.
- Multisig wallet specs can be exported via NFC, and new multisig wallet can be imported over NFC.
- Menu re-org: 
    - "Export Wallet" now directly under Advanced Menu and
      duplicate link remains under File Management.
    - "Dump Summary" moved from Backup menu to Export
    - "Advanced" now "Advanced/Tools"
    - shuffled contents of Advanced menu
    - "New Wallet" renamed "New Seed Words"
- Text changes to match reality that writing "files" can happen to SD card or VirtDisk or NFC.
- New users will see some prompts to help them get started, after seed is set.
- 12 word seeds are now an option from the start, either by TRNG or Dice Roll
- Dice rolls (for new seed) moved from Import (a misnomer) to "New Seed Words"
- Duress wallet (from trick pin) will be 12-words if your true seed is 12-words
- Bugfix: allow sending to scripts that we cannot parse, with a warning, to support
  `OP_RETURN` and other outputs we don't understand well (yet).
- Bugfix: sending NFC things into the Coldcard was not working, fixed.


## 5.0.1 - 2022-03-24

- bugfix: red light whenever MCU keys changed or seed installed first time.

## 5.0.0 - 2022-03-14

Mk4 - New hardware

- (Mk3&Mk4) Performance improved: some internal objects cached to reduce delays when
  accessing master secret. Helps address explorer, many USB commands and signing.
- Enhancement: Power-down during the login countdown now resets the time delay to force 
  attacker (or yourself) to start over with full delay time.
- Enhancement: if an XFP of zero is seen in a PSBT file, assume that should be replaced by
  our current XFP value and try to sign the input (same for change outputs and change-fraud
  checks). This makes building a workable PSBT file easier and could be used to preserve
  privacy of XFP value itself. A warning is shown when this happens.
- Enhancement: "Advanced > Export XPUB" provides direct way to show XPUB (or ZPUB/YPUB) for
  BIP-84 / BIP-44 / BIP-49 standard derivations, as a QR. Also can show XFP and master XPUB.
- (Mk4) PSBT files up to 2 megabytes now supported
