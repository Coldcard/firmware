# sram2.py - Jam some larger, long-lived objects into the SRAM2 area, which isn't used enough.
#
# Cautions/Notes: 
# - mpy heap does not include SRAM2, so doing manual memory alloc here.
# - top 8k reserved for bootloader, which will wipe it on each entry
#   - top page of that is specially marked to cause reset if any attempt to change
# - 2k at bottom reserved for code in `flashbdev.c` to use as cache data for flash writing
# - keep this file in sync with simulated version
