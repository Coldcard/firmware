# Very limited space in serial flash, so we compress as much as possible:
# - would be bad for privacy to store these **UTXO amounts** in plaintext
# - result is stored in a JSON serialization, so needs to be text encoded
# - using base64, in two parts, concatenated
#       - 15 bytes are hash over txnhash:out_num => base64 => 20 chars text
#       - 8 bytes exact satoshi value => base64 (pad trimmed) => 11 chars
# - stored satoshi value is XOR'ed with LSB from prevout txn hash, which isn't stored
# - result is a 31 character string for each history entry, plus 4 overhead => 35 each
# - if we store 30 of those it's about 25% of total setting space
